# python-opencv-face-recognition
A simple face recognition in python using opencv. I used LBPH Recognizer which is provided by the opencv module.
It can detect multiple faces and recognize them. 
You can fine tune the model and improve it more by taking the value of confidence into consideration.

# How to use
Install the following requirements:
1. Python 3
Below two are the modules you can install with Pip.
2. Opencv Contrib (https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/)
3. Numpy

Note: Make sure to use the OpenCv-contrib version. This module has the additonal functions which is needed for our FaceRecognition. To know more about it, look into their documentation.
